TODO:
  Do we need to think about texturing more? Thinking about weather everthing
  should have height 1 and a relative transform, or setters for position and
  size like the circle. I think the relative transform might cause our fill to
  stretch, like get more pixelated if it was huge. Think about this more,
  right maybe things show up perfectly textured (and font antialiased) if
  relative transform not set, but then things scale when relative transform set?
  Take time to think this one through...

  default to black color fill

  art workflow:
    everything in one document
    export with plugin

let try it:
    make texture colored how we want them, or different color versions...
    can relative path inkscape project?
    name your shit! keep the xml nice with IDS!
    make the grid of texture. turn to patterns name the patterns all by filename
    we can straight up text edit if makes easier!!!! use the power of sublime
    bring in the content we have make a test level
    try making some tree and frog animations
    try bringing it into the game!!! figure out how ids gonna work with getting the right stuff to the right places in the game
    python? keep what we can in python

code wish list:
  fix the walking jitter if possible
 
  stop sorting the same damn tree structure every frame!!

  tweening functions: this should be pretty simple to give a few easing functions

  make a simple time struct in updateable with delta_time and global_time and pass ref to that in update
c
  bezier class

  bound the springs!

features wish list:
  self occluding smoke

  rain do it!
  degenerate vertices in the clouds. should be easier with example animation code done
  particles could be harder, emitters might want to check occluder texture somehow

  big industrial wheel turning with cool shadows?

nitpicky things:
  acessors mixture of getblah() and blah()
  revisit pointer vs ref?
