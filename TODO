TODO:
  restructure:
    check if cpp only functions should be static
    remove screen_textured circle shade?
    circle drawer just draws one damn circle, use the scene graph for the rest
    make tile vs. stetch fill option
    why set up vaos per shape and not shape_data, probably a reason
    fix the walking jitter if possible

  art workflow:
    everything in one document
    export with plugin

let try it:
    make texture colored how we want them, or different color versions...
    can relative path inkscape project?
    name your shit! keep the xml nice with IDS!
    make the grid of texture. turn to patterns name the patterns all by filename
    we can straight up text edit if makes easier!!!! use the power of sublime
    bring in the content we have make a test level
    try making some tree and frog animations
    try bringing it into the game!!! figure out how ids gonna work with getting the right stuff to the right places in the game
    python? keep what we can in python
    
    you did it good job!! you have an art content pipeline now to make a crazy world!!
    think about which game companies to get in touch with and how...


code wish list:
  stop sorting the same damn tree structure every frame!!

  tweening functions: this should be pretty simple to give a few easing functions

  thought kill lock children instead shade group recursively set the attrs is wants on all children
  
  make a simple time struct in updateable with delta_time and global_time and pass ref to that in update

  modernize circle drawer to group of circles
  or at least make screen space texture quad then we can set circle extent to be fill and clean header

  bezier class

  bound the springs!

features wish list:
  self occluding smoke

  rain do it!
  degenerate vertices in the clouds. should be easier with example animation code done
  particles could be harder, emitters might want to check occluder texture somehow

  big industrial wheel turning with cool shadows?

nitpicky things:
  acessors mixture of getblah() and blah()
  revisit pointer vs ref?
