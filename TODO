TODO:
  last tweeks to content pipeline:
    read in transform
    read in fill? try it it might be easy to add all textures to inkscape
    give some sort of python script to autogen a basic group file
    done! move on to art

  art dawg. prototype some shit!

  trees up first!
  then birds ruins and frogs...
  then rain and friend
  then particles

story:
trees->birds->ruins->frogs->rainy valley->mountain->friend

code wish list:
  tweening functions: this should be pretty simple to give a few easing functions

  thought kill lock children instead shade group recursively set the attrs is wants on all children
  
  make a simple time struct in updateable with delta_time and global_time and pass ref to that in update

  modernize circle drawer to group of circles
  or at least make screen space texture quad then we can set circle extent to be fill and clean header

  bezier class

  bound the springs!

features wish list:
  self occluding smoke

  rain do it!
  degenerate vertices in the clouds. should be easier with example animation code done
  particles could be harder, emitters might want to check occluder texture somehow

  big industrial wheel turning with cool shadows?

nitpicky things:
  acessors mixture of getblah() and blah()
  revisit pointer vs ref?
