TODO:
  bring some code back in
  
  art dawg. prototype some shit!

story:
trees->birds->ruins->frogs->rainy valley->mountain->friend

code wish list:
  alpha functions: this should be pretty simple to give a few easing functions
  thought kill lock children instead shade group recursively set the attrs is wants on all children

  modernize circle drawer to group of circles
  or at least make screen space texture quad then we can set circle extent to be fill and clean header

  bezier class

  bound the springs!

features wish list:
  self occluding smoke

  rain do it!
  degenerate vertices in the clouds. should be easier with example animation code done
  particles could be harder, emitters might want to check occluder texture somehow

  better textures and more content

animation i need:
  thought bubble--done
  trees--static works in system
  frogs--ribbit works, jumping dont
  brids--not decided. but if done with mainly static body and wings flapping tots doable in current system
decision go with current system

nitpicky things:
  acessors mixture of getblah() and blah()
  revisit pointer vs ref?
